# NOW Mozilla Club
The official website of Network for the Open Web - a Mozilla Campus Club at MPSTME, Mumbai.

NOW was founded in 2018 with one purpose - well *technically*, three interwoven principles:
- Teach
- Build
- Protect

To that extent, the club has heads that are responsible with each one of these roles, along with a Club Captain to lead the way. We also have members belonging to cells suited to their skills.
We have conducted a couple of successful events, and have laid the groundwork for some more in the coming months.

We're committed to everything Open Source and all things Secure!

Check out the [website](http://nowmozilla.club) and stay tuned for more updates!

## The site was redesigned with Material Design by:
- Urmil Shroff
- Priyansh Ramnani
- Mamta Yadav
- Nirmit Agrawal
